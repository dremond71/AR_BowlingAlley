There are legitimate reasons to build for Android without enabling the ARCore plug-in, so this warning was not helpful.\n- Changed AR Foundation dependency version to 5.1.2.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue [ARFB-322](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-crash-on-android-when-artrackedimagemanager-component-is-added-to-the-ar-session-origin-game-object) where an image library that had an image(s) score too low with the [arcoreimg](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/augmented-images/arcoreimg) tool, or fail to score at all, would cause a crash at runtime."
